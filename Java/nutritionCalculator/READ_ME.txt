Description:
This is a calculator for a certain method of Carb Cycling that also uses the Harris Benedict formulas for 
calculating a person's BMR.  This method of Carb Cycling is taken from an article called, "The Carb 
Cycling Codex", published by Christian Thibaudeau on the t-nation.com website, with some additional components
on top of the original method.

Below is the link to the article, which is a total walk-through of this method (Does not include the additional
components).

Directions:
1.  Enter the your height, weight, and age (If you carry much excess body fat, 
	use a weight closer to lean body weight)
2.  Select Gender	
3.  Choose an activity level
4.  Choose a fitness goal
5.  Select protein to bodyweight pound ratio (Serious athletes will use at least 1.25 g protein / lb bodyweight,
	average to active individuals will use the lower ranges)
6.  View results




!!! IMPORTANT !!!

	1.  This Calculator works best for serious to hard-core individuals trying to either 
		A.  Gain mass while minimizing fat gain
					or
		B.  Loss fat while minimizing muscle loss	

	2.  The functions of this calculator do not attempt to diagnose or treat any kind of health problems or 
		diseases

	3.  Use this calculator as a GUIDE.  The results of these calculations are just estimates and do not 
		describe the function and status of any one person's body.  Therefore, branching out from this diet 
		method may possibly yield better or worse results... All peoples bodies are different!!!
		
	4.  This program does not make any attempt to teach this method of carb-cycling, but only functions to 
		aid in its calculations
